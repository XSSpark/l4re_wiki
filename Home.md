# The L4Re Operating System Wiki

The L4Re Runtime Environment is an operating system framework for building
systems with real-time, security, safety and virtualization requirements. It
consists of the [L4Re hypervisor/kernel](https://l4re.org/fiasco/) and a
user-level infrastructure that includes basic services such as program loading
and memory management. L4Re also provides the environment for applications,
including libraries and process-local functionality.
